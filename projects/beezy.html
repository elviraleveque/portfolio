        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Beezy</span> is an app that aims to help young fellows that travel for work and want
            to explore the nicest and coolest places around during their free time.
        </p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>
            When we started this project, we didn't know what direction it would take, but we had our "humans" clearly
            in mind: <span class="highlight">solo travelers</span>.
            To get to know them better, we started with a survey to collect some <span class="highlight">quantitative
                data</span>.
            Our main focus was on: <br>
            - Finding out why solo travelers prefer to travel alone;<br>
            - Understand if they would enjoy a temporary companion during their travels.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, we did not manage to find a common pattern among the respondents, which led us to conclude
            that <span class="highlight">our target group was too broad</span>, so we had to narrow it down.

            In reviewing the data we had collected using this different approach, we discovered a <span
                class="highlight">more specific segment</span>:
            business travelers. <br>

            <span class="highlight">Business travelers</span> are people who travel for work and whose trips typically
            last 2/3 days.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point, we switched to <span class="highlight">qualitative research</span> and structured a short interview to understand users'
            pains and desires.
        </p>

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>To illustrate our finding, I created a <span class="highlight">user persona</span>.</p>

        <h3>Early solution</h3>
        <p>The first solution was an app that suggests activities near you, depending on how much time you have. It focused on three points:<br>
            1. <span class="highlight">Time setting</span>: since business travellers have limited time, it is important for them that the activities they're going to do fall within the available time frame.<br>
            2. <span class="highlight">Selected results</span>: taking into account the time available, the place where they are and the type of activity they're looking for (food, art, park...)<br>
            3. Badge system</span>: a collection of places where the user has been using the app, and badges to reward and keep them motivated.
        </p>

        <h3>Usability testing</h3>
        <p>To test our <span class="highlight">early solution</span> we used Marvel. The Usability testing have been foundamental, since allowed us to observe the user's behavior and listen for feedback.</p>
        <p>We had three main goals in mind:<br>
        - Identify problems in the design and the navigation of the app.<br>
        - Learn about the target user preferences.<br>
        - (Hopefully) uncover opportunities to improve.</p>

        <p>For this reason, we organized <span class="highlight">3 short sessions</span>, giving the user a <span class="highlight">specific task to perform</span>, observing them, and then asking for feedbacks.</p>
