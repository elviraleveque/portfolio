        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Beezy</span> is an app that aims to help young fellows that travel for work and want
            to explore the nicest and coolest places around during their free time.
        </p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>
            When we started this project, we didn't know what direction it would take, but we had our "humans" clearly
            in mind: <span class="highlight">solo travelers</span>.
            To get to know them better, we started with a survey to collect some <span class="highlight">quantitative
                data</span>.
            Our main focus was on: <br>
            - Finding out why solo travelers prefer to travel alone;<br>
            - Understand if they would enjoy a temporary companion during their travels.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, we did not manage to find a common pattern among the respondents, which led us to conclude
            that <span class="highlight">our target group was too broad</span>, so we had to narrow it down.

            In reviewing the data we had collected using this different approach, we discovered a <span
                class="highlight">more specific segment</span>:
            business travelers. <br>

            <span class="highlight">Business travelers</span> are people who travel for work and whose trips typically
            last 2/3 days.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point, we switched to <span class="highlight">qualitative research</span> and structured a short interview to understand users'
            pains and desires.
        </p>

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>To illustrate our finding, we created a <span class="highlight">user persona</span>.</p>

        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>To illustrate our finding, we created a <span class="highlight">user persona</span>.</p>
