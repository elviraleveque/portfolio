        <h3>About</h3>
        <p> <span class="highlight">Waily</span> is an app for iOS that allows you to monitor your <span
                class="highlight">water consumption</span> in order to avoid waste and achieve, therefore, a more
            sustainable long-term lifestyle </p>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Water is a <span class="highlight">limited resource</span>, in fact the water that can be consumed by human
            beings corresponds to <span class="highlight">less than 1% of all the water on Earth</span>; the rest is
            salt and ice water. In addition to being an
            ever-decreasing resource, as the population continues to grow water is also the epicenter of climate change.
            Just think of
            rising sea levels due to melting ice, or storms and subsequent flooding. <br>
            Another datum to consider is the distinction between <span class="highlight">visible water</span> and <span
                class="highlight">invisible water</span>. <br>
            Most of the water that is consumed in homes is visible, and it is the water used for drinking, eating, and
            for personal and
            household hygiene. Household water consumption corresponds to about 137 L per day for each household. <br>
            The problem is that, however, <span class="highlight">visible water is only a small part</span> of the total water consumption of each
            individual. <br>
            Two categories of invisible water are distinguished: the water used for the production of
            <span class="highlight">industrial products</span>, such as paper, cotton and clothing, which corresponds to
            about 167 L per day, and the
            water used for the production of <span class="highlight">food</span>, which corresponds to 3469 L of water
            per day, or 92% of total
            consumption.
        </p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Tracking of consumption</span><br>
            The main feature is the tracking of daily consumption, specifically divided into four categories: <span class="highlight">indoor</span> (consumption made within your home), <span class="highlight">outdoor</span> (related to activities such as gardening or pool maintenance), <span class="highlight">food</span> (consumption of invisible water used for the production of food) and <span class="highlight">clothing</span> (invisible water used for the production of garments, a type of consumption therefore is more related to companies than to the individual).<br>
            These four categories are also used to catalog the <span class="highlight">"challenges"</span>, that are the activities recommended to the user in order to <span class="highlight">save water</span>. For example, in the indoor category there is the challenge "short showers" which suggests the user not to spend more than 5 minutes in the shower, because every minute less saves up to 39 L. Or, in the food category there is the challenge "Vegan Day", which explains to the user that on average people who habitually consume meat consume up to 5000 L of water per day; which is why, avoiding the consumption for a day, you can save the same amount of liters of water.<br><br>
            
            <span class="highlight">Monthly estimate</span><br>
            Another core feature is the monthly estimate of the <span class="highlight">cost of consumption</span>. Based on the consumption entered by the user related to the indoor and outdoor categories, ie the categories that affect the cost of the bill, the app help the user to understand the trend of its consumption also in economic terms.<br><br>
            
            <span class="highlight">Information paths</span><br>
            Finally, among the main features, there is the section on information, in which there are short information paths about the theme of water and everything that is related. In addition, each of these, presents practical advice on how to have an impact in reality.</p>
