        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Monefy</span> is an existing app that let you keep track of your
            incomes and your expenses.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started to use the app because I needed to figure out how I was using my money, and the free version of
            this app was perfect since it has all the features I need: <br>
            - Incomes and expenses tracking <br>
            - Balance overview <br>
            - Possibility to add and manage multiple accounts. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            In spite of that, from the first use of the application, you can immediately spot the <span
                class="highlight">weaknesses of the UX</span> (and of the UI too).
            That's why I decided to focus on three main screen of the app and try to improve it according to my vision.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, I wanted to improve my knowledge in <span class="highlight">data handling</span> using <span
                class="highlight">SwiftUI</span>, therefore this application was ideal for my purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>Starting point and analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The screen I decided to focus on are: <br>
            1) The first screen, with the <span class="highlight">general overview</span> <br>
            2) The <span class="highlight">list</span> with all the transactions <br>
            3) The screen through which is possble to <span class="highlight">add new transactions</span>.
        </p>

        <div class="mockup">
            <img src="../static/img/projects/monefy/old1.png" alt="">
            <img src="../static/img/projects/monefy/old2.png" alt="">
            <img src="../static/img/projects/monefy/old3.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
            The first screen is visibly <span class="highlight">too messed up</span>: <br>
            - The <span class="highlight">navigation bar</span> contains too many elements; in addition, the logo should
            not be repeated within an app.
            <br>
            - The <span class="highlight">chart</span> in the center, in my opinion, is difficult to read and interpret
            voluptuously, also because there are too many categories<br>
            - Furthermore, in the middle there are two digits, respectively the money earned and the money spent in a
            given period, information that I consider to be secondary to the <span class="highlight">balance</span>,
            placed instead at the bottom
            (that's also the way tou can access the list of all your transactions). <br>
            - Finally the <span class="highlight">buttons at the bottom</span> to add a gain or an expense are
            unsightly.
        </p>

        <p>
            About the other two screens, the UX is quite ok, but a general restyle in design can give them a better look.
        </p>

        <h3>Final result</h3> 
        <p>
            This is the result of the UX and UI restyling I made:
        </p>
        <div class="mockup">
            <img src="../static/img/projects/monefy/new1.png" alt="">
            <img src="../static/img/projects/monefy/new2.png" alt="">
            <img src="../static/img/projects/monefy/new3.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>
            Here they are the main improvements:<br>
            - The <span class="highlight">navigation bar</span> in now a lot more clean.<br>
            - The <span class="highlight">chart</span> in the center now only returns the balance, that is also written in its center, while the detail of incomes and expenses are placed just below it. <br>
            - A <span class="highlight">quick overview of the last transactions</span> is now present in the main screen, with the possibility to see the whole list by simply tapping on "Show all"<br>
            - A <span class="highlight">single button</span> to add new transactions replaced the old two buttons, and it opens a <span class="highlight">modal view</span> istead of a new screen.<br>
            - <span class="highlight">Colors</span> have been made brighter, so that the app has a more pleasant look.
